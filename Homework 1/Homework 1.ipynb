Considering the Earth has been around for nearly 4.6 billion years now, and with a probability of having a bright supernovae in a given century being p=0.5, it would make sense that we would have at least four centuries in a row without one at some point in the Earth's history.

That's 60,000 centuries, implying that in that duration, we would have had $60000\\cdot 0.0625=3750$ blocks of four consecutive centuries that did not have supernovae. That's a lot. So it is definitely not unrealistic that we had one such scenario in the last millenia.\n","\n","Another possible way we can show that the number of record bright supernovae events and the years in which they occured are statistically consistent is by checking how realistic it is to have three supernovae within the first half millenia (five centuries) of the years 1000-2000 BCE.

Having more data points would be more helpful for finding the true value for the probability of having a supernovae in a century (as extrapolating wouldn't be a very good idea here), but otherwise we have completed our goal in finding two methods that show that our data for the number of recorded bright supernovae events and the years in which they occured are statistically consistent."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Nq2AP2iypsoU"},"source":["**Task 4c.
